# Metasploitable Nmap Vulnerability Scan

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates network scanning and service enumeration on a vulnerable VM (Metasploitable2) from a Kali Linux attacker machine. The goal is to identify open ports, running services, and potential vulnerabilities.

## Environment
- **Attacker VM:** Kali Linux
- **Target VM:** Metasploitable2
- **Network:** Host-Only
- **Attacker IP:** 192.168.56.102
- **Target IP:** 192.168.56.101

## Tools
- Nmap
- Wireshark

## Steps
1. Verified network connectivity using `ping`.
2. Conducted basic ping and port scans.
3. Ran service version detection using `nmap -sV`.
4. Performed aggressive scan using `nmap -A`.
5. Optionally, ran vulnerability scripts using `nmap --script vuln`.
6. Captured network traffic in Wireshark (optional).

## Findings
- Open Ports: [Add results]
- Services and Versions: [Add results]
- Observed Vulnerabilities: [Add results]
- Notes: [Add any observations]

## Screenshots
